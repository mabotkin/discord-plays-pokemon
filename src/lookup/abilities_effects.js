"Drizzle" : "The weather changes to rain when this Pokémon enters battle and does not end unless replaced by another weather condition.\n\nIf multiple Pokémon with this ability, drought, sand stream, or snow warning are sent out at the same time, the abilities will activate in order of Speed, respecting trick room.

"Battle Armor" : 'Moves cannot score critical hits against this Pokémon.\n\nThis ability functions identically to shell armor.' ,
"Sturdy" : 'When this Pokémon is at full HP, any hit that would knock it out will instead leave it with 1 HP.  Regardless of its current HP, it is also immune to the one-hit KO moves: fissure, guillotine, horn drill, and sheer cold.\n\nIf this Pokémon is holding a focus sash, this ability takes precedence and the item will not be consumed.' ,
"Damp" : 'While this Pokémon is in battle, self destruct and explosion will fail and aftermath will not take effect.' ,
"Limber" : 'This Pokémon cannot be paralyzed.\n\nIf a Pokémon is paralyzed and acquires this ability, its paralysis is healed; this includes when regaining a lost ability upon leaving battle.' ,
"Sand Veil" : 'During a sandstorm, this Pokémon has 1.25x its evasion, and it does not take sandstorm damage regardless of type.\n\nThe evasion bonus does not count as a stat modifier.\n\nOverworld: If the lead Pokémon has this ability, the wild encounter rate is halved in a sandstorm.' ,
"Static" : "Whenever a move makes contact with this Pokémon, the move's user has a 30% chance of being paralyzed.\n\nPokémon that are immune to electric-type moves can still be paralyzed by this ability.\n\nOverworld: If the lead Pokémon has this ability, there is a 50% chance that encounters will be with an electric Pokémon, if applicable." ,
"Volt Absorb" : "Whenever an electric-type move hits this Pokémon, it heals for 1/4 of its maximum HP, negating any other effect on it.\n\nThis ability will not take effect if this Pokémon is ground-type and thus immune to Electric moves.

"Insomnia" : 'This Pokémon cannot be asleep.\n\nThis causes rest to fail altogether.  If a Pokémon is asleep and acquires this ability, it will immediately wake up; this includes when regaining a lost ability upon leaving battle.\n\nThis ability functions identically to vital spirit in battle.' ,
"Color Change" : "Whenever this Pokémon takes damage from a move, the Pokémon's type changes to match the move.\n\nIf the Pokémon has two types, both are overridden.  The Pokémon must directly take damage; for example, moves blocked by a substitute will not trigger this ability, nor will moves that deal damage indirectly, such as spikes.\n\nThis ability takes effect on only the last hit of a multiple-hit attack.\n\nIn Pokémon Colosseum and XD: Gale of Darkness, this ability does not take effect on Shadow-type moves." ,

This ability takes effect even on non-damaging moves, i.e. will o wisp." ,
"Shield Dust" : 'This Pokémon is immune to the extra effects of moves used against it.\n\nAn extra effect is a move\'s chance, listed as an "effect chance", to inflict a status ailment, cause a stat change, or make the target flinch in addition to the move\'s main effect.

"Own Tempo" : 'This Pokémon cannot be confused.\n\nIf a Pokémon is confused and acquires this ability, its confusion will immediately be healed.' ,

"Intimidate" : "When this Pokémon enters battle, the opponent's Attack is lowered by one stage.  In a double battle, both opponents are affected.\n\nThis ability also takes effect when acquired during a battle, but will not take effect again if lost and reobtained without leaving battle.\n\nThis ability has no effect on an opponent that has a substitute.\n\nOverworld: If the first Pokémon in the party has this ability, any random encounter with a Pokémon five or more levels lower than it has a 50% chance of being skipped." ,
"Shadow Tag" : 'While this Pokémon is in battle, opposing Pokémon cannot flee or switch out.\n\nOther Pokémon with this ability are unaffected.  Pokémon with run away can still flee.  Pokémon can still switch out with the use of a move or item.' ,

"Levitate" : 'This Pokémon is immune to ground-type moves, spikes, toxic spikes, and arena trap.\n\nThis ability is disabled during gravity or ingrain, or while holding an iron ball.  This ability is not disabled during roost.' ,
"Effect Spore" : "Whenever a move makes contact with this Pokémon, the move's user has a 30% chance of being paralyzed, poisoned, or put to sleep, chosen at random.\n\nNothing is done to compensate if the move's user is immune to one of these ailments; there is simply a lower chance that the move's user will be affected." ,
"Synchronize" : "Whenever this Pokémon is burned, paralyzed, or poisoned, the Pokémon who gave this Pokémon that ailment is also given the ailment.\n\nThis ability passes back bad poison when this Pokémon is badly poisoned.  This ability cannot pass on a status ailment that the Pokémon did not directly receive from another Pokémon, such as the poison from toxic spikes or the burn from a flame orb.\n\nOverworld: If the lead Pokémon has this ability, wild Pokémon have a 50% chance of having the lead Pokémon's nature, and a 50% chance of being given a random nature as usual, including the lead Pokémon's nature.  This does not work on Pokémon received outside of battle or roaming legendaries." ,
"Clear Body" : 'This Pokémon cannot have its stats lowered by other Pokémon.\n\nThis ability does not prevent any stat losses other than stat modifiers, such as the Speed cut from paralysis.

"Lightning Rod" : "All other Pokémon's single-target electric-type moves are redirected to this Pokémon if it is an eligible target.  Other Pokémon's Electric moves raise this Pokémon's Special Attack one stage, negating any other effect on it, and cannot miss it.\n\nIf the move's intended target also has this ability, the move is not redirected.  When multiple Pokémon with this ability are possible targets for redirection, the move is redirected to the one with the highest Speed stat, or, in the case of a tie, to a random tied Pokémon.  follow me takes precedence over this ability.\n\nIf the Pokémon is a ground-type and thus immune to Electric moves, its immunity prevents the Special Attack boost." ,
"Serene Grace" : "This Pokémon's moves have twice their usual effect chance.\n\nAn effect chance is a move's chance to inflict a status ailment, cause a stat change, or make the target flinch in addition to the move's main effect.

This effect does not stack if multiple Pokémon have this ability or flame body.' ,
"Water Veil" : 'This Pokémon cannot be burned.\n\nIf a Pokémon is burned and acquires this ability, its burn is healed; this includes when regaining a lost ability upon leaving battle.' ,
"Magnet Pull" : 'While this Pokémon is in battle, opposing steel-type Pokémon cannot flee or switch out.\n\nPokémon with run away can still flee.  Pokémon can still switch out with the use of a move or item.\n\nOverworld: If the lead Pokémon has this ability, Steel-type Pokémon have a higher encounter rate.' ,
"Soundproof" : 'This Pokémon is immune to moves flagged as being sound-based.\n\nheal bell is unaffected.  uproar still prevents this Pokémon from sleeping.  This Pokémon can still receive a Perish Song counter through baton pass, and will retain a Perish Song counter if it acquires this ability after Perish Song is used.\n\nhowl, roar of time, sonic boom, and yawn are not flagged as sound-based.' ,
"Rain Dish" : 'This Pokémon heals for 1/16 of its maximum HP after each turn during rain.' ,

Each ability's weather will cancel the previous weather, and only the weather summoned by the slowest of the Pokémon will stay.\n\nOverworld: If the lead Pokémon has this ability, the wild encounter rate is halved in a sandstorm." ,
"Pressure" : "Moves targetting this Pokémon use one extra PP.\n\nThis ability stacks if multiple targets have it.  This ability still affects moves that fail or miss.  This ability does not affect ally moves that target either the entire field or just its side, nor this Pokémon's self-targetted moves; it does, however, affect single-targetted ally moves aimed at this Pokémon, ally moves that target all other Pokémon, and opponents' moves that target the entire field.  If this ability raises a move's PP cost above its remaining PP, it will use all remaining PP.\n\nWhen this Pokémon enters battle, all participating trainers are notified that it has this ability.\n\nOverworld: If the lead Pokémon has this ability, higher-levelled Pokémon have their encounter rate increased." ,
"Thick Fat" : 'This Pokémon takes half as much damage from fire- and ice-type moves.' ,

"Run Away" : 'This Pokémon is always successful fleeing from wild battles, even if trapped by a move or ability.' ,
"Keen Eye" : "This Pokémon cannot have its accuracy lowered.\n\nThis ability does not prevent any accuracy losses other than stat modifiers, such as the accuracy cut from fog; nor does it prevent other Pokémon's evasion from making this Pokémon's moves less accurate.  This Pokémon can still be passed negative accuracy modifiers through heart swap.\n\nOverworld: If the first Pokémon in the party has this ability, any random encounter with a Pokémon five or more levels lower than it has a 50% chance of being skipped." ,
"Hyper Cutter" : "This Pokémon's Attack cannot be lowered by other Pokémon.\n\nThis ability does not prevent any Attack losses other than stat modifiers, such as the Attack cut from a burn.  This Pokémon can still be passed negative Attack modifiers through heart swap or power swap." ,
"Pickup" : "At the end of each turn, if another Pokémon consumed or Flung a held item that turn, this Pokémon picks up the item if it is not already holding one.  After each battle, this Pokémon has a 10% chance of picking up an item if it is not already holding one.\n\nThe air balloon and eject button cannot be picked up.\n\nThe items that may be found vary by game, and, since Pokémon Emerald, by the Pokémon's level.  This ability is checked after the battle ends, at which point any temporary ability changes have worn off." ,
"Truant" : 'Every second turn on which this Pokémon should attempt to use a move, it will instead do nothing ("loaf around").\n\nLoafing around interrupts moves that take multiple turns the same way paralysis, flinching, etc do.  Most such moves, for example bide or rollout, are simply cut off upon loafing around.  Attacks with a recharge turn, such as hyper beam, do not have to recharge; attacks with a preparation turn, such as fly, do not end up being used.  Moves that are forced over multiple turns and keep going through failure, such as outrage, uproar, or any move forced by encore, keep going as usual.\n\nIf this Pokémon is confused, its confusion is not checked when loafing around; the Pokémon cannot hurt itself, and its confusion does not end or come closer to ending.\n\nIf this Pokémon attempts to move but fails, e.g. because of paralysis or gravity, it still counts as having moved and will loaf around the next turn.  If it does not attempt to move, e.g. because it is asleep or frozen, whatever it would have done will be postponed until its next attempt; that is, it will either loaf around or move as usual, depending on what it last did.\n\nThis ability cannot be changed with worry seed, but it can be disabled with gastro acid, changed with role play, or traded away with skill swap.' ,
"Hustle" : "This Pokémon's physical moves do 1.5x as much regular damage, but have 0.8x their usual accuracy.\n\nSpecial moves are unaffected.  Moves that do set damage, such as seismic toss, have their accuracy affected, but not their damage.\n\nOverworld: If the lead Pokémon has this ability, higher-levelled Pokémon have their encounter rate increased." ,
"Cute Charm" : "Whenever a move makes contact with this Pokémon, the move's user has a 30% chance of being infatuated.\n\nOverworld: If the first Pokémon in the party has this ability, any wild Pokémon whose species can be either gender has a 2/3 chance of being set to the opposite gender, and a 1/3 chance of having a random gender as usual." ,
"Plus" : 'This Pokémon has 1.5x its Special Attack if any friendly Pokémon has plus or minus.\n\nThis bonus does not count as a stat modifier.  If either ability is disabled by gastro acid, both lose their effect.' ,
"Minus" : 'This Pokémon has 1.5x its Special Attack if any friendly Pokémon has plus or minus.\n\nThis bonus does not count as a stat modifier.  If either ability is disabled by gastro acid, both lose their effect.' ,
"Forecast" : "During rain, strong sunlight, or hail, this Pokémon's type changes to water, fire, or ice, respectively, and its form changes to match.\n\nThis ability has no effect for any Pokémon other than castform.\n\nIf the weather ends or becomes anything that does not trigger this ability, or a Pokémon with air lock or cloud nine enters battle, this Pokémon's type and form revert to their default.  If this ability is lost or disabled, this Pokémon cannot change its current type and form until it regains its ability." ,
"Sticky Hold" : "This Pokémon's hold item cannot be removed by other Pokémon.\n\nDamaging moves that would remove this Pokémon's item can still inflict damage against this Pokémon, e.g. knock off or pluck.

"Marvel Scale" : 'Whenever this Pokémon has a major status ailment, it has 1.5x its Defense.\n\nThis bonus does not count as a stat modifier.' ,
"Liquid Ooze" : 'Whenever a Pokémon would heal after hitting this Pokémon with a leeching move like absorb, it instead loses as many HP as it would usually gain.\n\ndream eater is unaffected.' ,
"Overgrow" : 'When this Pokémon has 1/3 or less of its HP remaining, its grass-type moves inflict 1.5x as much regular damage.' ,

Each ability's weather will cancel the previous weather, and only the weather summoned by the slowest of the Pokémon will stay." ,
"Arena Trap" : 'While this Pokémon is in battle, opposing Pokémon cannot flee or switch out.  flying-type Pokémon and Pokémon in the air, e.g. due to levitate or magnet rise, are unaffected.\n\nPokémon with run away can still flee.  Pokémon can still switch out with the use of a move or item.\n\nOverworld: If the lead Pokémon has this ability, the wild encounter rate is doubled.' ,
"Vital Spirit" : 'This Pokémon cannot be asleep.\n\nThis causes rest to fail altogether.  If a Pokémon is asleep and acquires this ability, it will immediately wake up; this includes when regaining a lost ability upon leaving battle.\n\nThis ability functions identically to insomnia in battle.\n\nOverworld: If the lead Pokémon has this ability, higher-levelled Pokémon have their encounter rate increased.' ,
"White Smoke" : 'This Pokémon cannot have its stats lowered by other Pokémon.\n\nThis ability does not prevent any stat losses other than stat modifiers, such as the Speed cut from paralysis; nor self-inflicted stat drops, such as the Special Attack drop from overheat; nor opponent-triggered stat boosts, such as the Attack boost from swagger.  This Pokémon can still be passed negative stat modifiers through guard swap, heart swap, or power swap.\n\nThis ability functions identically to clear body in battle.\n\nOverworld: If the lead Pokémon has this ability, the wild encounter rate is halved.' ,
